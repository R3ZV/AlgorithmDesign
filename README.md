Implementation of various algorithms from 'The Algorithm Design Manual' with
a focus on graphs.

Supported algorithms:

- [x] Determining number of islands on a map (In a 2D Grid)
- [ ] Kruskal
- [ ] Strongly Connected Components
- [ ] Topologic sort

# Tests

Each algorithm was tested on a coding platform as follows:

- [x] No. of islands on [Counting Rooms](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1192).
