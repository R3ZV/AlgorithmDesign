# Algorithm Design

Implementation of algorithms presented in the book "The Algorithm Design Manual"
and more.

One of my ideas:

A combination of linked list and array and vector, when you
are over the capacity you allocate 2 * what you had but instead of
copying the data over, you make a new node in the linked list that
points to the new allocated area.
